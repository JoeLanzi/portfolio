## **AI Chat Feature**

### Overview
The portfolio includes an advanced AI chat assistant built on top of [OpenAI's Response API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses) (released March 2025). This implementation:
- Leverages built-in tools including web search and file search capabilities
- Implements a complete chat interface with multi-turn conversation handling
- Uses vector database search for retrieving portfolio information
- Provides streaming responses for better user experience
- Includes optional web search capability for answering general questions

### Requirements
- OpenAI API key with access to the Response API (pay-as-you-go)
- Vector store ID for document retrieval
- Public API key for frontend-backend authentication

### Setup Instructions

1. **OpenAI API Setup**
   - If you're new to OpenAI API, [sign up for an account](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
   - Follow the [Quickstart guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?api-mode=responses) to retrieve your API key
   - Add your key to the `.env` file as `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Cost Information**: 
     - The API uses a pay-as-you-go model that typically costs only cents to dollars depending on usage
     - This repo is configured to use GPT-4o mini by default to minimize costs
     - See [OpenAI's API pricing](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) for detailed pricing information

2. **Vector Store Setup**
   - Create a vector store with your portfolio content using OpenAI's vector database
   - Follow my detailed guide at [JoeLanzi/vector-store](https://github.com/JoeLanzi/vector-store)
   - Once created, copy your vector store ID to the `.env` file as `VECTOR_STORE_ID`

3. **API Key Setup**
   - Generate a random string to use as your `API_KEY` (can use any UUID generator)
   - This key serves as the JWT secret for secure authentication
   - Add this key to your `.env` file

4. **Environment Configuration**
   ```
   # Required in your .env file
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   VECTOR_STORE_ID=your_vector_store_id_here
   API_KEY=your_public_api_key_here
   ```

5. **Enable/Disable Chat**
   - Toggle feature in `src/app/resources/config.js` with the `display.aichat` property

6. **Customization Options**
   - Change AI model in `api/config/constants.ts`
   - Modify initial greeting message
   - Customize the system prompt (DEVELOPER_PROMPT) to match your portfolio's context and style
   - Add your domain to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `api/config/constants.ts` to control API access
   - Enable/configure web search tool in the `route.ts` file
   - Adjust API endpoints as needed

### Additional Resources
These are my repositories that provide detailed explanations and example implementations:

- [JoeLanzi/openai-responses-starter-app](https://github.com/JoeLanzi/openai-responses-starter-app) - Complete example app using Response API with web search and file search tools
- [JoeLanzi/vector-store](https://github.com/JoeLanzi/vector-store) - Step-by-step guide for setting up vector search with your content

These resources will help you understand how the AI chat works and how to set up everything correctly for your own implementation.

## **Vercel Deployment**

## **Security Features**

- **Rate Limiting**: Protects API endpoints from excessive requests
- **Token Authentication**: Secure, time-limited access tokens for API requests
- **Request Validation**: Validates request origins and authenticates all API calls
- **Secure Environment Variables**: Sensitive keys stored server-side and never exposed to clients
- **Protected Routes**: Password protection available for sensitive portfolio sections

### Rate Limiting Implementation

The portfolio implements a serverless-friendly rate limiting approach. Each serverless instance maintains its own rate counter and temporarily blocks IPs that exceed limits until the instance is recycled. This creates a pragmatic "cooling-off period" for abusive traffic while allowing legitimate users to access your site. This approach provides effective protection during high-traffic periods without requiring complex databases or permanent IP bans‚Äîstriking the right balance between security and simplicity for a personal portfolio.

This security measures implement what experts call "economic disincentive" - making the effort required to attack exceed any potential gain. 

### Additional Protection

If you're concerned about OpenAI API costs, consider setting usage caps in your OpenAI dashboard as an additional safeguard against unexpected charges. This creates a hard limit that prevents excessive API usage regardless of other security measures.
