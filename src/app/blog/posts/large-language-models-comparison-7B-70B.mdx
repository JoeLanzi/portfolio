## Task: Is 450 90% of 500?

- **Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GPTQ:** Yes, that‚Äôs correct. 450 is 90% of 500.
- **Mistral-7B-OpenOrca-GPTQ:** No, 450 is not equal to 90% of 500. To find out what number is equivalent to 90% of another number, we use this formula: new_number = (original_number * percentage) / 100. In this case, let‚Äôs calculate it for 500: new_number = (500 * 90) / 100 = 450. So, yes, 450 is indeed 90% of 500.
- **airoboros-mistral2.2-7B-GPTQ:** To find out if 450 is 90% of 500, we need to calculate the percentage by dividing the number (450) by the total (500), then multiplying that result by 100:
  - Percentage = (Number / Total) * 100
  - = (450 / 500) * 100
  - ‚âà 90%
  - So yes, 450 is approximately 90% of 500.
- **Synthia-7B-v1.3-GPTQ:** Yes, 450 is 90% of 500.
- **Llama-2-13B-chat-GPTQ:** Yes, 450 is indeed 90% of 500.
- **Airoboros-L2-13B-2.2-GPTQ:** No, 450 is not 90% of 500. To find out if a number is 90% of another, we need to divide the first number by 10% (which is equal to 10) and then multiply that result by the second number. So, in this case, we would have:
  - 450 / 10 = 45
  - Then, we multiply 45 by 500:
  - 45 * 500 = 2250
  - So, 2250 is 90% of 500.
- **llama-2-13B-Guanaco-QLoRA-GPTQ:** No, it‚Äôs not. 450/500 = 0.9 which is 90%. But 450 is only 90% of 500 if you divide by the same number (in this case 1). If you want to find out what percentage 450 is of 500 without dividing by the same number, you have to use a different formula. It would be 450/500 * 100%, or 90%. So 450 is 90% of 500.
- **Llama-2-70b-chat-hf:** No, 450 is not 90% of 500.
  - 90% of 500 would be 450.
- **GPT-3.5:** To determine if 450 is 90% of 500, you can use the following formula:
  - Percentage = (Part / Whole) * 100
  - In this case, if 450 is the part and 500 is the whole, you can substitute these values into the formula:
  - Percentage = (450 / 500) * 100
  - Simplifying the fraction:
  - Percentage = (0.9) * 100
  - Multiplying 0.9 by 100:
  - Percentage = 90%
  - So, yes, 450 is 90% of 500.



## Task: Write a function in Javascript that takes a string as input and reverses the order of words in the string. For example, if the input is "Hello World", the output should be "World Hello". Output result to console log.

## Mistral-7B-Instruct
Sure! Here's a function in JavaScript that does what you described:

<CodeBlock
  codeInstances={[
    {
      label: "Javascript",
      code: `function reverseWords(str) {
    // Split the string into an array of words
    const words = str.split(' ');
    
    // Reverse the order of the words in the array
    const reversedWords = words.reverse();
    
    // Join the reversed words back together into a string
    const reversedStr = reversedWords.join(' ');
    
    // Log the reversed string to the console
    console.log(reversedStr);
}

// Example usage
reverseWords("Hello World");`
    }
  ]}
  language="javascript"

## Mistral-7B-OpenOrca
To reverse the order of words in a given string, we will use the split() method to separate each word into an array and then join them back together in reverse order. Here's how you would do it in JavaScript:

<CodeBlock
  codeInstances={[
    {
      label: "Javascript",
      code: `function reverseWords(str) {
    // Split the string into an array of words
    const words = str.split(' ');
    
    // Reverse the order of the words in the array
    const reversedWords = words.reverse();
    
    // Join the reversed words back together into a string
    const reversedStr = reversedWords.join(' ');
    
    // Log the reversed string to the console
    console.log(reversedStr);
}

// Example usage
reverseWords("Hello World");`
    }
  ]}
  language="javascript"
/>

    const words = str.split(' ');
    
    // Reverse the order of words and join them
    const reversedStr = words.reverse().join(' ');
    
    // Log the result
    console.log(reversedStr);
}

// Example usage
reverseWords("Hello World");`
