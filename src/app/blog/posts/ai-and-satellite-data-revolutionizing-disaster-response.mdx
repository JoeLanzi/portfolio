    Flood Risks Assessment
</figcaption>  

Recent advances in machine learning and Earth observation technology have opened up new possibilities for rapidly assessing damage after natural disasters, allowing humanitarian groups to respond more quickly and efficiently.  

The recent breakthrough collaboration to unlock the power of geospatial data and satellite imagery for enterprise and humanitarian applications has been a game-changer. By combining cutting-edge machine learning, extensive satellite datasets, and innovative geospatial analytics, this pioneering initiative has enabled unprecedented disaster prediction capabilities and data-driven prioritization of relief efforts worldwide.  

As team lead, I spearheaded an initiative to revolutionize disaster damage assessment using **Project SKAI** – an AI system from Google Research that analyzes satellite imagery to detect building damages – and **Google Cloud Platform** machine learning capabilities, including **Vertex AI**, to enable predictive modeling for storm surge risks and other disasters.  

Google SKAI was developed through collaboration between Google and the **UN World Food Programme** to accelerate humanitarian response. It uses deep learning and very high-resolution imagery to pinpoint collapsed structures, powering data-driven decision-making.  

By skillfully synthesizing SKAI’s capabilities and proprietary AI & ML methods with response protocols and geospatial systems, we achieved remarkable results – risks and damage assessments that once took weeks were completed in hours. Aid could be precisely targeted to the most affected communities.

## Framework Approach  

1. **Image Processing**  
   - Processed high-resolution **SkySat satellite imagery** from Planet Labs using tools like **Google Earth Engine** and **ArcGIS**.  

2. **Smart Building Damage Analysis**  
   - Applied cutting-edge technology, **SKAI**, to automatically assess and classify damages in buildings from satellite images.  

3. **Efficient Data Labeling**  
   - Used **Google Vertex AI** for streamlined labeling tasks, speeding up the process of identifying damaged buildings in disaster-hit areas.  

4. **Customized Machine Learning**  
   - Trained custom ML models in **Vertex AI**, exploring different architectures for accurate identification of building damages.  

5. **Swift Deployment and Predictions**  
   - Deployed the trained model back into **Vertex AI** for rapid predictions on new satellite images depicting disaster-induced damages.  

6. **Automation for Aid Focus**  
   - Developed **Python scripts** using **Google Earth Engine** to automate damage reports and aid prioritization based on severity.  

7. **User-Friendly Visualizations**  
   - Created easy-to-understand maps and visuals using **ArcGIS** and **Google Earth Engine dashboards**.  

8. **Effective Stakeholder Communication**  
   - Presented interactive maps and insights to stakeholders using accessible platforms like **ArcGIS StoryMaps** and **Google Earth Studio**.  

9. **Balanced Risk Assessment**  
   - Conducted comprehensive risk assessments by analyzing a century of natural disaster data.  
   - Leveraged **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** for accurate predictions of potential disaster severity.  

10. **Accelerating Disaster Response**  
    - This streamlined process, utilizing advanced technology and cloud services, significantly sped up disaster response and recovery efforts.

The collaboration between [**Planet Labs**](https://www.planet.com/) and [Google](https://blog.research.google/2020/06/machine-learning-based-damage.html) highlights the vast potential of partnerships in driving positive change. Breaking down barriers and uniting diverse capabilities allowed us to overcome intricate challenges that no single institution could address in isolation.  

Looking ahead, there is boundless potential to further harness synergies, envision breakthroughs, and deploy geospatial technology for **humanitarian aid**, **disaster resilience**, and beyond. Our success serves as a testament to the **transformative impact** of a shared vision and complementary abilities, profoundly enhancing life on Earth through constructive collaboration.
